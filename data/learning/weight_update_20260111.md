## 📝 Adjustments Made

*No adjustments needed - weights remain optimal*

## 🎯 Optimization Rationale

Model weights are continuously optimized based on:

1. **Prediction Confidence**: Higher confidence predictions favor ensemble methods
2. **Confidence Variance**: High variance favors stable models like LSTM
3. **Win Rate Performance**: Successful strategies get reinforced
4. **Adaptive Learning**: AutoML weight increases during uncertain conditions

These adjustments ensure AI Prophet continuously evolves and improves accuracy.
